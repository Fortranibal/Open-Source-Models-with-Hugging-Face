    "Some use cases and services that can be built using these models are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic Similarity - Measure the semantic similarity between two sentences. Duplicate detection, question answering, and recommendation systems, where understanding the similarity between sentences is essential for accurate responses or recommendations.\n",
    "- Information Retrieval - Index and retrieve relevant information from large collections of documents or text data. Search for and retrieve documents that are semantically similar to the user's query.\n",
    "- Clustering and Classification - Clustering similar sentences together or classifying sentences into predefined categories. Text classification, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, where grouping or categorizing sentences based on their semantic meaning is necessary.\n",
    "- Contextual Understanding - Capture the contextual nuances and relationships between sentences, enabling conversational models to understand the context in which sentences are used. Beneficial in tasks such as dialogue systems, where maintaining context and coherence is essential for generating natural and coherent responses."
